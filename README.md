# 3D-Motion-Capture
About  :
        In this project we will use a video to mark landmarks on our performer , whose actions and movements we wish to copy and integrate in our character flawlessly.
        In this project we used pycharm for python coding which created the landmarks , then used thosed landmarks to mark anchor points of our character's nodes based on the x,y,z-axis of the perfomer,
        then unity hub is used to create solid for the character and animation is integrated using C sharp scripting, below are the steps to complete this project.

Step 1:
        Choose any video or choose given media (video.mp4) or import the video of performer , whose actions are wished to be copied.
        Copy the main.py , import the necessary libraries and run in it  any platform eg. visual studio ( I used pycharm) to mark the landmarks on the performer.
